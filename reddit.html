<h1>About Reddit</h1>
    <div class="Paragraph">
<p>Reddit is a social media platform that allows people to sign up and create their own
personal account, be able to vote and comment on other users uploads to the site.
To help regulate the social media platform and prevent spammers from annoying
daily Reddit users, they came up with “Karma” points. Users get karma points by
their comments and posts, the more “up-votes” (also known as likes on other sites)
they get, the more karma points they will earn.
Reddit is a place for everything on the internet and its where the best content is
posted. If you are interested in anything there is a place on Reddit for it.
On this platform, you can make your own page about a certain topic. This is called a
“Sub-reddit”.
As an example, if you were interested in Web Development, you could join the
“r/webdev” sub-reddit, and tons of people share stuff from their successful website
skills to their problems that they cant fix and they need other peoples help. In this
sub-reddit there is 500k members so there is plenty of people to help someone that
    is confused.</p></div>

    <h1>Installation/Registration</h1>
        <div class="Paragraph">
     <p>On Reddit, you don’t have to create an account to view content but to be able to vote on users uploads or join sub-reddit’s, you will have to create an account.
      The process is really simple, you click sign up; enter your email, choose a     username, make a password. And that’s it, then you’re good to go.</p>

            <p>There is a desktop version of the app that is available for pc users or they can view it on any web browser. On mobile there is an app that you can download on the app store.</p></div>
    
    <h1>How it can be used in a learning enviroment</h1>
            <div class="Paragraph">
     <p>1. The first way it could be used is when a teacher creates a reddit page for
his/her students, to inform them with various assignments that may be given in
that class and the same with homework. This works because the students can
comment on any quires about the work that has been given and the teacher
can give feedback.</p>
 <p>2. The second way it could be used is for discussions on various topics that
might have been discussed in class, during that teaching. Students can
communicate with one another in the comments section expressing their
opinions on whatever topic.</p>
 <p>3. The third way it could be used for learning purposes is, people can post about
various events that may be occurring globally, for instance the corona virus. It
has been trending worldwide and people are uncertain about how they should
react to it. On reddit people can give their opinions on it, quite like Twitter
     there is discussion on it daily as seen here:</p></div>
