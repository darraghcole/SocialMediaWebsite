    <h1>Installation/Registration</h1>
    <div class="Paragraph">
       
    <p>In order to get whatsapp on your device you need go to the App Store or Play Store and
search for it in the search bar. Then you click on the app icon and on the right-hand side there should be a
little cloud if its iPhone or a bar saving "download". You click on that and the app will be installed. How to
register: Once you download the app the app will guide you through registration itself. You will be asked to
confirm your country code and enter your phone number. After that you will have to verify your phone
number. You will receive a message with a code which you then put into the app to clarify your phone
        number. Then you will be asked to add your name and a profile photo which is optional.</p></div>
    
    <h1>How to use the App</h1>
     <div class="Paragraph">       
    <p>Open what’s app on your mobile device and you will see
the main chat page.
This is where you keep track of all messages, calls and
status changes. Along the top row you have the search tab
so you can look for recent or not so recent messages.
Beside the search tab is the settings with three dots. This
is used to open a new group chat, all your favourite or
(starred) messages and out to change your account
settings along with themes, wallpaper and how you receive
notifications.
On the bottom right corner is the message tab where you
select the contact you wish to write to and begin
        messaging, it is that easy.</p></div>


<div class="Paragraph">
<p>Step 2.
Once you click the green message icon on the bottom
right and choose the contact you wish to use, you are
taken to this screen where you type the message you
want to write and hit enter. If this is too slow for you
or you prefer to talk you can use the record setting on
the bottom right icon instead. Holding this button and
speaking will record anything you say and once
released it will send the voice message.
In the top right corner you have 3 icons, these are
video call, phone call, and contact settings for this
    specific contact which you will see below.</p></div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<p>Step 3 and 4

If you press the three dot settings icon on the top right
corner while in any specific chat with a contact you are
taken to a menu. This is where you can view the
contacts details, send them images or documents, turn
off the notifications for that person, change the
wallpaper for that chat to give it a more personalised
look. If you want to report
a contact to what’s app
services or even block the
contact from messaging
you again, Just press the
three dots on the top right
hand side while in chat
with the specific contact
you wish to report/block
    then press the “more” tab.</p></div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<p>Step 5.
The Status option allows you to share text, photo,
video and GIF updates that disappear after 24 hours,
similar to snapchat. In order to send and receive
status updates to and from your contacts, you must
have each other's phone numbers saved in your
phones' address books. To
update this is easy. Just
click the status tab and
tap the my status title
    beside your profile photo.</p></div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<p>Step 6.
Adding documents allows you to send photos, files,
maps and even other contact information to a
chosen contact. To do this just open a chat with a
contact and in the bottom right there is a paperclip
icon that you press to show more options. Just tap
which ever icon you wish to send and it will send
    whatever you wish the contact to see.</p></div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<p>Step 7.

If you want to add a group with as many contacts as you
want, simply tap the settings icon (three dots on the top
right hand side) then tap the first icon which says “New
group”. Once you do this you will be taken into your
contact list where you select all the people you want in
your group and select the
green arrow.
Once you do this you can
type the name of the group
and also an Icon to represent
that group. You can add
emoticons via the smiling face
emoji beside the subject.
Once you are done, select the
green icon with the tick
and you’re all set up for
    the group chat.</p></div>
    
    <h1>How it can be used in a learning enviroment</h1>
        <div class="Paragraph">
    <p>Now that technology is a big part of our lives especially in
the life’s of younger people (students) teachers should take
advantage of this.
Being able to directly talk to students, send lecture notes
and pass on any important data would in fact bring ideas not
only for the students but to get feedback in how the work
can be presented making it simpler for the teacher.
It is estimated that about 1 billion people use WhatsApp
with 300 million daily users and 5 million for education; the
permission to use WhatsApp in all forms of education would
        bring these numbers up.</p></div>
