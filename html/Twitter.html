<h1>About Twitter</h1>
    <div class="Paragraph">
        <p>Twitter is an application that you can download on any android or apple phone through the app/play store for free. Twitter is a social media platform that allows you to post messages known as “tweets”, it allows you to like posts by other users and retweet their posts on your own page. Twitter was founded in 2006 in San Francisco. On twitter you can use the hashtag key before a relevant word, this allows your tweets to be found easier by other users. By clicking on a hashtag in a tweet it brings you to any other tweets that also include that word or phrase. Twitters logo since 2010 is of a white bird on a light bluebackground. The bird is said to be the “twitter bird” and that’s why the posts are called “tweets”, as that is the sound the bird would make so it makes sense.</p></div>

    
<h1>Registration</h1>
    <div class="Paragraph">
      <p>Registering an account for twitter is very simple and
        easy that basically anybody at any age that’s old
        enough for the application can make an account
          All you need is either an email address or a phone number to get started.</p></div>
    <div class="Paragraph">
    <p>Once you type up twitter on google it will load you up
     to this page where you can either make an account or
     sign into an existing account, if the person already had
        an account they would head straight into twitter and wouldn’t see this page.</p></div>
    <div class="Paragraph">
    <p>When you press sign up you will be introduced to this
page and you have created a username for your
account and you also have to either put your email

address down or your phone number
The reason you have to do either one of them is
because it will help twitter contact you just in case
        something happened to your account.</p></div>
    
    <div class="Paragraph">
    <p>Once you made your account you will be brought into
this screen and depending on which option you picked
they will send a code to your email or number and ask
        you to type it in just to make sure you’re not a bot or fake account.</p></div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<p>After that they will ask you to make a password it can
    be anything it just has to be at least 6 letters long.</p></div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<p>After all that is done twitter will ask you to select thing
that you are interested in, this will help them find and
    help you choose on what and who to follow on twitter since it’s your first time on the app.</p></div>
