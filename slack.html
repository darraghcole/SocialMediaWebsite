It was designed this way in order to help support the way people naturally work together, so that they can collaborate with other people online as efficiently as you do face-to-face.

    <h1>How it can be used in a learning enviroment</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="Paragraph">
    <p>There are many different ways for a teacher or lecturer to use social media to help teach his or her class
one way they are able to use it is to post homework when they are not able to do so in class as well as
informing students and their families about upcoming events. Another way it can help is if a student is not
sure about something they can send them a message instead of hoping the bump into each other and ask
face to face it can also be used to upload lecture videos in to group chat in facebook and twitter for people
who could not come in that day. it can also be used to monitor a students progress a prime example is the use of moodle.</p>
    </div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<p>One way that Slack can be used to help in teaching is in the making of study groups when doing group
assignments. This way groups do not have to meet on scheduled days but can also communicate and help
each other in the comfort of their own home sending files and emails to one another and exchanging ideas
    and asking for their opinion and since it is almost instant you dont have to worry about about a lag in communication.</p> </div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<p>As I said above it can also be for things other than study groups as it allow the class teacher or lecturer
included to alway be able to interact with each other even outside of school allowing the student to get the
    most up to date information about work and events like when are grades our out straight from the staff.</p>
